                            By 2050, one in four young people on the planet will be African. 
                            By 2100, estimates predict that many of the world’s largest cities will be in Africa, and we will represent more than a third of the world’s population. Our continent faces rapidly escalating demands for fresh water and food production. In addition, it is home to essential natural resources the world depends upon. 
                            Pressures on our landscapes come both from within and outside Africa.
                            Decisions made now about where to place dams, build roads, and grow food could decimate our biodiversity and compromise global resilience to climate change. 
                            They must be guided by sound science and the recognition that we cannot survive without healthy ecosystems. 
                            We must embrace this moment and create African-led pathways where economic opportunity and conservation are complementary.

                            The Foundation appreciates its strong working relationships with national, regional, and local governments in each country where we work. 
                            We also understand that it takes more than one organization to accomplish our mission. EF's major partnerships help to mobilize resources, design strategies, and implement programs to benefit the wildlife and wildlands of Africa.

                            For 60 years, African Wildlife Foundation has been ahead of the curve in developing innovative conservation strategies so wildlife, wild lands, and people can thrive. 
                            Our approach is uniquely comprehensive, addressing not only direct threats to wildlife like poaching and habitat loss, but also working with communities and governments to ensure that African conservation is truly African owned and led.
